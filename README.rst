evcape
======

``evcape`` makes modifier keys (shift, control) more useful
by simulating another key press (for instance escape or backspace)
when they are pressed and immediately released.

this tools is a small daemon that listens to keyboard events using the
linux input subsystem, and uses simple rules to detects patterns and
take corresponding actions.

it uses ``evdev``, ``udev`` and ``uinput`` and hence works with wayland and
on the console.

Usage
==============

.. code:: sh

  # if remaping capslock as in DEFAULT_RULES
  setxkbmap -option "caps:ctrl_modifier" 
  sudo ./evcape.py

Dependencies
==============

``evcape`` uses python's evdev and udev libaries.
On debian, ``apt install python3-evdev python3-pyudev``

current status
==============

*WARNING*: this is alpha quality software, use at your own risk!

- keyboard input event detection works
- keyboard simulation works
- monitoring of hotplug events (external keyboards) works
- rules are built-in and can only be changed by editing the source code
