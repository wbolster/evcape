evcape
======

``evcape`` makes your ``caps lock`` key work as both ``ctrl`` and
an ``esc`` key, depending on whether you combine it with another key
(acts as ``ctrl``) or release it immediately (acts as ``esc``). this
is ideal for vim bindings.

in general, ``evcape`` simulates an additional key press (e.g. escape
or backspace) when a modifier key (e.g. shift or control) is pressed
and immediately released.

``evcape`` is a small daemon that listens to keyboard events using the
linux input subsystem, and uses simple rules to detects patterns and
take corresponding actions.

it uses ``evdev``, ``udev`` and ``uinput`` and hence works with
wayland and on the console, unlike ``evcape``'s inspiration,
``xcape``.

crrent status
==============

*WARNING*: this is alpha quality software, use at your own risk!

- simple rule language for configuration works
- keyboard input event detection works
- keyboard simulation works
- monitoring of hotplug events (external keyboards) works

installation
============

``evcape`` is written using python 3.

make sure you have the python (3) libraries installed for:

- evdev
- pyudev
- six

on debian/ubuntu this would be::

  apt install python3-evdev python3-pyudev python3-six

alternatively, use a `virtualenv` for isolation::

  virtualenv --python=python3 venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

usage
=====

make caps lock an extra control. gnome has a ui for it:
gnome-tweak-tool, keyboard, extra options, ‘caps lock is control’.
alternatively, use something like this::

  setxkbmap -option "ctrl:nocaps"

then run evcape::

  ./evcape.py

you may need to run with root permissions to access raw input devices::

  sudo ./evcape.py

or, if you use a virtualenv::

  source venv/bin/activate
  python ./evcape.py

pass ``--help`` for usage options.

custom rules
------------

by default, the built-in rules make caps/control act as escape.
alternatively, specify your own rules on the command line.

start at login
--------------

to start upon login, one option is to use a systemd user service,
e.g. ``~/.config/systemd/user/evcape.service``.
here is an example with some custom rules::

  [Unit]
  Description=evcape

  [Service]
  ExecStart=/path/to/evcape.py \
      press:leftctrl,release:leftctrl=press:esc,release:esc \
      press:capslock,release:capslock=press:esc,release:esc \
      press:rightshift,release:rightshift=press:backspace,release:backspace \
      press:rightctrl,release:rightctrl=press:backspace,release:backspace
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target

running as a normal user
------------------------

(note: this is based on an ubuntu system.)

``evcape`` operates on a fairly low level of the input stack: it needs
to access to raw input devices to read events and also needs to inject
keyboard events. this means ``evcape`` is both a ‘key logger’ (without
logging anything!) and a fake keyboard.

things like that can typically only be don by the ``root`` user, but
this can be avoided by elevating your user's privileges to access
input devices. this improves the situation somewhat, but keep in mind
that ``evcape`` still has complete control over the input stack.

typically, input devices are owned by the group ``input``::

  $ ls -al /dev/input/event0
  crw-rw---- 1 root input 13, 64 jan  3 13:26 /dev/input/event0

adding yourself to that group will enable you to use those devices::

  $ sudo adduser $(whoami) input

to simulate key presses, ``/dev/uinput`` is used, which is owned
by root directly. this can be changed to use a newly created
``uinput`` group::

  $ sudo addgroup --system uinput
  $ sudo adduser $(whoami) uinput

add a udev rule to make ``/dev/uinput`` use this group by
creating a new file, ``/etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules``,
with these contents::

  KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="uinput", MODE:="0660"

it may be necessary to explicitly load the ``uinput`` kernel module for
the rule to apply correctly. this can be done by creating a new file,
``/etc/modules.load.d/uinput.conf`` with these contents::

  uinput

now reboot to make all changes take effect. afterwards, it should look
like this::

  $ ls -al /dev/uinput
  crw-rw---- 1 root uinput 10, 223 jan  3 13:26 /dev/uinput
